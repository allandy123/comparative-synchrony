Raw ANUSPLIN data are available at ftp site below, or by running script 0 in this package. ftp://ftp.nrcan.gc.ca/pub/outgoing/North_America_Historical_Grids/geotif/

These data are not included in the package because they are large files. If you run that script, data will first be downloaded the folder ./data/weather/raw_download/, and then unpacked into folders by year in the folder ./data/weather/raw/. Those folders contain metadata for the weather files. 

These data are used to extract data for our analysis. The extracted data is availble in the folder ./data/weather/25km.
